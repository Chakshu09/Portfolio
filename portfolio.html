I’m a natural leader. I’ve eventually been promoted
 to a leadership role in almost every project because I like to help people. I find co-workers usually come to me with questions or concerns even when I’m not in a leadership role because if I don’t know the answer, I’ll at least point them in the right direction.<br>
